These are assets I have found in random places on the internet which I
shall now proceed to credit:

## The font

According to the Debian wiki, this is a free version of the commercial
paid font used for their logo (https://wiki.debian.org/DebianLogo).
I will trust the Debian wiki on this, especially since the link to the
website at the link below is dead. I just liked this font, if there is ever
an issue with using it, please open an issue, I will replace it with something else.
